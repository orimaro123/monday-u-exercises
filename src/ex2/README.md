## Clarification:

### The video is played from index.html
### I understand that although my code is working I needed to change the logic by approaching ItemManager as an external service and making improvements
### I started changing the logic on NEW files but stoped due to lack of time.
### The NEW files can be played by NEWIndex.html

## Functional features working:

- [x] Refactor your current code to use classes with methods (you can copy+paste the code to a new file and refactor there - just make sure to update the `scripts` tag in your `index.html`)
- [x] Create an ItemManager class (in a new file) to manage the item adding/removing + pokemon fetching - this class does _not_ deal with the DOM
- [x] Store todos in an array (class attribute) - this should be in the ItemManager class
- [x] Render todos from the array using a separate render method
- [x] Remove todos by updating the list and re-rendering
- [x] Create a PokemonClient class (in a new file) to get data from the Pokemon API - remember the HTML has to be aware of this file...
- [x] If the user only inputs a number, add a `Catch ${pokemon}` todo to your array of todos (and render it, of course)
- [x] If the user inputs a comma separated list of IDs, retrieve multiple pokemon in parallel using `Promise.all` and render them all
- [x] Handle any errors in retrieving the pokemon (i.e. when a user inputs an invalid ID like 44124. See below gif for an example)
- [x] Add a normal todo item if the input is not a pokemon

### Bonus

- [x] Add a delete all option - make sure you're actually deleting the data, not just removing from the DOM
- [x] Validate that the user isn't adding the same pokemon todo more than once
- [x] Get more nested data from the pokemon API and display it as part of the todo item (e.g. “catch bulbasaur the grass/leaf type pokemon”)
  - you'll have to explore the API to understand where to extract that data from =]
- [x] Modify the API request to use a pokemon’s name instead of its ID if you find a pokemon name (from a closed list of values) in the user’s input. For example, if the user inputs "charmender", you should get the data about charmender from the API by this pokemon's name - you'll have to read the docs for this too to see how that works ;)
- [x] In the solution file you'll see this piece of code: `pokemons.forEach(this.addPokemonItem);`
  - The `addPokemonItem` method adds the pokemon to the array of todos and renders the todos list again
  - Can you figure out why this line of code is inefficient? Can you improve it?
- [x] Have another cool idea? Go wild!
## Have fun catching Pokemons :)
